I have Bachelors and Masters degrees in Civil Engineering and nine years professional working experience in the structural engineering field. During that time, I have gained experience in both design and inspection of bridges. But it was data-related projects in the industry that I have found the most engaging and this was the driving force in my decision to make a career shift to data science. I plan to utilize the machine-learning skills I have recently developed, in combination with my previous technical experience, to provide data-based solutions to todayâ€™s challenges.
