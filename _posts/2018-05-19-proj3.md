# Battleground Counties in the 2016 Election

## Summary
I decided to take a look at the 2016 election results by county and determine which counties were the most undecided in the country. I wanted to see if any demographic trends could be uncovered for these particular counties.

### Data
Data for this investigation was based on American Community Survey and New York Times data.

### Method
Supervised machine learning methods were employed using classification.
