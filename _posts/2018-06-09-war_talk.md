## Summary
Presidential addresses (written and spoken) were analyzed for patterns during wartime. Clustering algorithms were used to group language into different categories. The prevalence of these categories was visualized to compare conflicts during different presidential administrations.

## Data
Presidential address data for this investigation was scraped from the [Miller Center website](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches). The dataset spanned all presdients from George Washington in 1789 through to Donald Trump in 2019. They included convention, inaugural, state of the union, farewell as well as various other addresses. A total of just under 1000 documents were used for this analysis.

## Topic Modeling
Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to generate topics for the analysis. First, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was used to transform address text data into a format that can be used by machine learning techniques. Each word in the total dataset was counted per occurrence. TF-IDF then determined which words tended to be specific to a particular document and generated numerical values for each word accordingly.

Next, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was utilized to take the TF-IDF matrix and group words into twenty specific topics. This unsupervised machine learning procedure returned an array of numerical weights for each topic in all addresses. Based on the top words in each topic, labels were manually assigned. The twenty topics produced in this process roughly fit into the following seven general topic categories:

- Government
- Economy
- War
- Ideals
- International
- National Issues
- General Words

To visualize the grouping of the twenty topics, a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plot was produced using the greatest (most weighted) topic in each address. This machine learning technique reduced the high-dimensionality of the data down to two dimensions. Each address is plotted below, labeled by each of the twenty topics and colored by each of the seven general categories. Since clusters are generally apparent, it looks like NMF did a good job grouping topics for the dataset. It's interesting to observe what topics share spatial similarity. The topics in the Economy category are diagonally aligned at the upper left region. Three of the Government topics are horizontally aligned toward the right side of the plot. Towards the center bottom, the four War topics surround the International-Global topic which is adjacent to the Ideals-Values topic. This makes sense, since those wars were inherently international affairs and a leader would need to use idealistic, values-based language to motivate the general public during those conflicts.

The topic weights generated by NMF were then converted to percentages. As an example, a particular speech might be composed of the following topics: 50% World War II; 30% Global; and 20% Values. These frequencies were averaged over the 1789-2019 date range. This shows that the Values topic in the Ideals category was the most used topic throughout US history.

...and here is a plot of the frequencies when grouped by their respective topic categories. Here the Government category is shown to be most prevalent throughout history.

## Results
Language patterns were analyzed during the following four major US conflicts:
- Civil War
- World War II
- Vietnam War
- War on Terror

The topic category frequencies were averaged per year of each conflict. These frequencies are displayed in the bar charts in the sections below. The most prominent topic's key words are displayed in word clouds.

The Civil War occurred during Abraham Lincoln's administration. His method of addressing the nation during this conflict is unique compared to others. Lincoln primarily used language related to the Government topics during the war. The most prevalent Government topic was Law. No specific Civil War topic was generated during NMF and only in the last year of the war (1865) did the War category become substantial. The War topic displayed in the bar chart is actually the World War II topic. The World War II topic contains many generic war-related words and so could be used for various conflicts.

The speech pattern used by Lincoln may have been an attempt not to antagonize the South during the conflict and instead to focus on common principles of the nation. Or perhaps presidents were less direct in discussing war before the twentieth century. In either case, this pattern is quite different from the other wars analyzed for this project.

Franklin Roosevelt was president during World War II. War broke out in 1939 in Europe but the US did not enter the war until late 1941. The World War II topic is a significant component of Roosevelt's speeches up until that point as support for the Allies was no secret in his administration. In the bar chart, a sharp spike in the World War II topic is apparent after US entry. It remains the dominant topic until the last year of the war. In 1945, the International category is most prevalent signifying an evolving outlook as the conflict's end was in sight.

While the World War II topic contains many words that are generic to any war, the major belligerents of this conflict are identified - "japan", "germany", "italy", "british".

The Vietnam War spanned the administrations of both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War topic is a major component of Johnson's addresses to the nation throughout his administration (with the exception of 1965). The topic's staying power in the later years of his second term indicate his commitment to sustained action in Vietnam.

Interestingly, Nixon doesn't mention the Vietnam War much while campaigning in 1968. However once his administration starts, the topic spikes. In the years after 1971, the topic plummets along with public support for the war.

*Topic category frequency during Vietnam War (Nixon)*

The Vietnam War topic is specific to the conflict - "vietnam", "southeast", "asia", "communist" are top words. Words such as "peace" and "aggression" may have been terms used to sway public opinion. The word "tonight" is prominent indicating the continuous communication to the public throughout the war. Such immediate communication was not possible in prior conflicts.

For the purposes of this analysis, the War on Terror ranged from the September 11th attacks in 2001 through to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. These dates span the presidency of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The War on Terror topic is a prominent topic in Bush's speeches during most years. There is a spike in 2003 corresponding to the invasion of Iraq and another in 2007 coinciding with the surge of troops in Iraq starting in that year.

*Topic category frequency during War on Terror (Bush)*

The topic plummeted during Obama's presidency. This correlates with his public opposition to the conflict in Iraq and a re-focus on National Issues during the Great Recession. Interestingly, there is an up-tick of the topic in 2011. It may have been politically advantageous to publicize the successful killing of the al-Qaeda leader which occurred that year.

*Topic category frequency during War on Terror (Obama)*

The War on Terror topic contains words related to terrorism, the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. Words such as "security", "regime", "attack" and "threat" indicate terms used to motivate public support for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as the expansion of government powers (e.g., the Patriot Act).

## Conclusions
The bar plots demonstrate that a president's commitment and approach to a particular conflict can be identified in their address patterns. Major events related to those conflicts can be reflected in their communications as well. The word clouds generated for specific topics shed light on terms used to motivate public support for wartime policy.
